# ZenDesk-2.0

## Project Architecture
ZenDesk-2.0 is a desk that is meant to enhance groupwork and improve effeciency among individuals. The main architecture of this project will involve microcontroller units that will be integrated within the desk itself and communicate amongst the many features that this desk will have such as unidirectional microphones, an LCD, cooling pads, an LED array, and other features. 

## Work Completed
* Design Draft
* Design Revision
* Unity Testing with Microphone
* Wireframes and Mockups
* Github Setup
* Pre-Alpha Build Documentation

## Known Bugs and Issues
* We have found some issues with the LCD not being consistent with startup
* The microphone is very sensitive when getting sound input
* File handling and secruity measures still need to be looked into; unsure about the implementation of the two
